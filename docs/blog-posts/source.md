# A Beginner's Guide to GitHub

## Introduction
Effective code management, change tracking, and team collaboration all depend on version control.  The most popular version control system, Git, is integrated into Visual Studio Code. 

## Why use Sourse Control?
1. Track Changes: It keeps a history of the changes in code made.
2. Collaboration: Creats a easier base to work with team members.
3. Rollback & Recovery: Shows the previous versions of changes.
4. Branching & Merging: Experiment with new features without affecting the main project.

git --version
```
If Git is installed, you will see the version number. 
Initialize a Git Repository

Navigate to your project folder, initialize a new Git repository and configure Git.
Set up your username and email.
