# Creating virtual environmnent in Visual Studio Code

## Introduction 
In Python projects, maintaining dependencies requires a virtual environment, or venv.  VS Code ensures that your project remains separate from system-wide packages by making the creation and use of venvs simple. When you install packages into a virtual environment it will end up in this new folder, and thus isolated from other packages used by other workspaces.

## Why use Virtual Environment?
> Dependency Management: In many different Python projects, this helps avoid conflicts.
> Reproducibility: They help ensure the different environment are consistent across the projects.
> Isolation: THis help prevents unnecessary errors from cluttering your global Python installation.

## How to Cceate a Virtual Environment in VS Code
1. In VS code, open your project file where you want to create the virtual environment.
