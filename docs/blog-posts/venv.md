# Creating virtual environmnent in Visual Studio Code

## Introduction 
In Python projects, maintaining dependencies requires a virtual environment, or venv.  VS Code ensures that your project remains separate from system-wide packages by making the creation and use of venvs simple. When you install packages into a virtual environment it will end up in this new folder, and thus isolated from other packages used by other workspaces.

## Why use Virtual Environment?
> Dependency Management: In many different Python projects, this helps avoid conflicts.
> Reproducibility: They help ensure the different environment are consistent across the projects.
> Isolation: THis help prevents unnecessary errors from cluttering your global Python installation.

## How to Cceate a Virtual Environment in VS Code
1. Open your project folder in VS Code
- Navigate to your project directory and open it in VS Code
2. . Create a virtual environment
Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
Type: Create Environment and select it
- Choose venv
- As the base select the interpreter you want for your virtual environment.
(0R)
2. Run the command `python -m venv venv` in the terminal.
3. To activate the virtual environment
Once the environment is created, VS Code will prompt you to select it for your workspace. Click Yes.

After activation, you should see (venv) appear in your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

### Dependancies
Once the venv is active, you can install project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you donâ€™t have a `requirements.txt`, you can install packages individually using:
```bash
pip install package-name
```
## Conclusion
Creating a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code is essential to keeping Python projects organized and productive. You can make sure your dependencies stay isolated and controllable by following these procedures.
